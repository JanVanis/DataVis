    "### February is usually a zero-sum game for the US investors on the stock market. The February of 2018 was somehow different and triggered bad memories of 2008 as investors watched the Dow Jones index plummet as much as almost 9% within a week. Have we just experienced the long-awaited correction, or should we fear that the market is trying to tell us something much worse might be around the corner? Let's find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is this \"Dow\"?\n",
    "How can we measure the performance of the whole market, you may ask? For this purpose, several stock market indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average index (\"the Dow\" for short), were created and are now used as the indicators of the stock market and sometimes are used as a proxy for the whole US economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dow is stock market index composed of 30 significant American companies whose stocks are traded at the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq (a global electronic marketplace). Invented back in 1896, the composition of the index changed a lot until today and continues to change to reflect shifts in the economy. Today, the index is composed of blue chips from diverse industries including Apple, JPMorgan Chase or McDonald's.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the Dow index is therefore derived from the prices of its components. It is price-weighted index meaning that stocks with higher prices are given a greater weight in the index. So, if an expensive stock such as the one of Boeing records an increase in its price, it will have a bigger impact on the value of the Dow than if a \"cheaper\" stock such as General Electric increases its value by the same amount. We can use the same logic to the case of a bear market of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OK, so what happened to the Dow?\n",
    "To explain what happened in February to the Dow, we have to put things into perspective and look at the development of the index in the last 8 years. The Dow showed an 8-year consecutive growth on the year-to-year basis as the companies were recovering from the crisis. The outlook of the economy was getting better every year as did the expected earnings of the companies. Between June 2009 and January 2018, the Dow more than tripled its value peaking at 26,186 points. The clich√© that the market goes up the staircase and down the elevator can be clearly seen from the following chart.\n",

The yields were expected to reach 3% by the end of 2018 but they reacted quickly than expected and by the end of February they were already at 2,86%. In other words, the bonds yields spiked as the result of increased interest rates by FED which was done to avoid higher inflation and the stock market reacted to that by declining."

Jeremy Siegel, finance professor at the Wharton School, accurately summed up last month on the stock market in these words: \n",
